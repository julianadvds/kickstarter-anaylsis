# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Kickstarter data to understand how launch dates and funding goals impacted different Kickstarter campaigns for Theatre Plays.  
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed on data from US Kickstarter campaigns from 2010-2017.  Two analysis were performed on the data set.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first was analyzing the outcome of different Theater kickstarter campaigns by the month of launch date [see image 1]. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 The second analysis performed on the data set analyzed the success outcome Theater and more specifically, Play campaigns based on the target goal.  The analysis compared the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled kickstarter campaigns grouped together by: less than $1000, $1000-$4999 and then in $5000 increments up to $50 000, and the final increment being >$50 000.  See [Image 2] for analysis.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While performing the analysis, it is possible that challenges may arise when ensuring that only the relevant data is being analyzed.  For example, in our analysis, we only reviewed campaings for Theater plays in the US.  If that selection was not done ahead of time, it is possible it would have changed the data and interpretation of the results.  In addition, in image 2, the percentage of canceled campaigns remains zero across all goal categories.  This is an easy data point to miss on the visualization.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
After analyzing the Theatre Outcomes based on Launch date, it can be concluded that May has the most campaigns launched, and the highest quantity of successful campaigns.  There are about the same number of failed campaigns launched in May, June, July, August and September.  December has the lowest number of successful campaigns.  Based on this, Theater campaigns launched in May have the best chance of success and those launched in December have the least chance of success.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, we can conclude that Theater-Play campaigns that have a goal of $35000 - $39999 have the highest percentage of successful campaigns.  Those campaigns launched with >$45000 outcome 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset is limited by the level of granularity.  Should we want to get further understanding on more specific types of data, such as genre of plays, that information is not available.  The data set also does not provide the data at the donation level so we are unable to calculate the median of the data to understand if the data is skewed.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
To further analyze the data, a graph calulating and visualizing the relationship between number of donations pledged and the campaign status (failed, successful, cancelled,) could be added.  Comparing the success rate of plays between different countries might tell a potential playwright where they are most likely to have a successful campaign.
